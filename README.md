keynote
=======

These are the scripts I wrote for monitoring live site services during my time at Microsoft AppEx team.
We used a paid service, [http://www.keynote.com/](Keynote) to ping our endpoints every five minutes.

They have two ways of monitoring. ApP and TxP.

We don't use this anymore, so it is legacy. Writing a README now is moot
